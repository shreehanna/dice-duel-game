# 🎲 Dice Duel — Python OOP Mini Game  
A fun little project where two players roll dice, battle it out for 3 rounds, and the one with the higher total wins. I built this to learn Object-Oriented Programming in Python — and also because writing `roll()` sounds cooler than writing `print("Hello World")`.

## 🛠️ How It Works
- Built using **Python OOP** concepts: I created classes for `Dice`, `Player`, and `Game`  
- Each player rolls a dice 3 times  
- Scores are tracked, and at the end we crown the winner 🏆  
- Uses `random.randint()` to simulate dice rolls

## 🔮 What I Learned
- How to **design and structure classes** (and not lose my mind)  
- The importance of keeping code clean, readable, and modular  
- Using OOP to simulate real-world objects like dice and players  
- `__init__`, `self`, and why Python makes me scream but in a fun way

## 🧪 Sample Output
🎲 Round 1:
Player 1 rolled a 4
Player 2 rolled a 2
→ Player 1 wins the round!

🎲 Round 2:
Player 1 rolled a 3
Player 2 rolled a 6
→ Player 2 wins the round!

🎲 Round 3:
Player 1 rolled a 5
Player 2 rolled a 1
→ Player 1 wins the round!

🏁 Final Score:
Player 1: 2 rounds
Player 2: 1 round

🥇 Player 1 wins the game!

## 💬 Final Word
I built this while learning Python from scratch. No tutorials, no copy-paste — just vibes, logic, and a lot of `print()` debugging. This mini project helped me understand the basics of OOP, and it's part of my journey toward getting better at Python, building ML projects, and (hopefully) landing that Apple AIML internship.
